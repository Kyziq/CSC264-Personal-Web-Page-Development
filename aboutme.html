                        Hey, I'm Khairul! This year, 2022, makes me 20 years
                        old. I come from a family of three, and I occupy the
                        third position, which is the last one. You know, I have
                        always been interested in the world of computers. Ever
                        since my father had a cybercafe when I was in primary
                        school, he exposed me to this astounding technology and
                        made me fascinated.
                    </p>

                    <!-- Para 2 -->
                    <p>
                        My dream that I have always looked up to, being an
                        amazing software engineer, is still far from my grasp.
                        Being able to learn computer science made me even closer
                        to it, and I will try my best to learn more and more! If
                        I feel like giving up, my favourite quote, which is
                        <b><i>"tomorrow is always a better day"</i> </b>, keeps
                        me motivated all day.
                    </p>
